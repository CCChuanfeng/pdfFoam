# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or sequence of words) that should
# identify the project. Note that if you do not use Doxywizard you need
# to put quotes around the project name if it contains spaces.

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag
# can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of
# the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the
# path to strip. Note that you specify absolute paths here, but also
# relative paths, which will be relative from the directory where doxygen is
# started.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = ..

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = ../mcParticle \
                         ../pdfSimpleFoam \
                         .

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank the following patterns are tested:
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.d *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh
# *.hxx *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.dox *.py
# *.f90 *.f *.for *.vhd *.vhdl

FILE_PATTERNS         += *.dox

# The EXTRA_PACKAGES tag can be to specify one or more names of LaTeX
# packages that should be included in the LaTeX output.
