# Sandia Propane Jet

## Experimental Data
The experimental data is available from the website of the
[TNF workshop](http://www.sandia.gov/TNF/DataArch/ProJet.html).

## Case Description
The inflow profiles of the co-flow have been computed from the experimental
data. For the jet, however, no such data is available, and hence the profiles
from the Sandia Flame D have been scaled. The TKE in the co-flow was computed
as

in the jet it was assumed to be

The turbulent dissipation was computed making a turbulence in equilibrium
assumption, resulting in
